Web crawler by Sandeep Rao:

This is simple Python based web crawler that starts from a link and downloads all the subsequent links in the page. This goes on till infinite depth until killed by the user. 

The code does not revisit already crawled links. The root webpage needs to be given as a command line argument.
e.g. python crawl.py http://www.topcoder.com/tc

The code is less than 30 lines in size ;)
